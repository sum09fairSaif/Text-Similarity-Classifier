# Text-Similarity-Classifier
Text Similarity Classifier built from scratch in Python. Designed, implemented, tested, and debugged independently for an Intro to CS course. Uses statistical language modeling (word frequency, stems, sentence structure, vowels) and log-likelihood scoring to classify unknown text sources.
